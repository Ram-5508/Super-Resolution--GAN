# Super-Resolution--GAN

Here I have used a GAN network to convert a degraded image into a high resolution image. The Generator generates a high resolution and the discriminator finds if the generated image is real or fake.

The generated images are attached here. The first image is the degraded image. The second image is the image generated by the generator and the third image is the real image.
